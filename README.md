# Algorithms Analysis Course
Welcome to my GitHub repository for the Algorithms Analysis course! In this repository, you will find my solutions to the course sheets and assignments, which are designed to test and enhance my knowledge of algorithms and their analysis.

## Course Overview
The Algorithms Analysis course covers a wide range of topics related to algorithms, including:

Algorithm design: Divide-and-conquer algorithms.
Algorithm design / Sorting algorithms I: Divide-and-conquer applications & Heap Sort.  
Sorting algorithms II: Bucket Sort and Radix Sort.  
Search trees I: Binary search trees, AVL trees, Tree traversals, Multiway search trees (was M-way trees).
Search trees II:B+ trees, Red-Black trees, and k-d trees.
Priority queues, Graph algorithms, Dynamic programming, Greedy algorithms, Backtracking algorithms, and much more.



## Folder Structure
In this repository, you will find the following folders
sheets: This folder contains my solutions to the course sheets, which are weekly problem sets designed to test my understanding of the material covered in class.
projects: The projects folder contains my personal projects related to algorithms analysis that I have developed outside of the course curriculum. These projects are intended to deepen my understanding of algorithms and their analysis, and to provide a practical application of the concepts that I have learned in class.
Some examples of the types of projects that you might find in this folder include:

Implementations of various sorting algorithms (e.g. bubble sort, insertion sort, merge sort) in different programming languages
Solutions to classic algorithmic problems (e.g. finding the shortest path between two nodes in a graph)
Algorithms for analyzing large datasets (e.g. clustering algorithms)
## Contributing
If you notice any errors or have suggestions for improving my solutions, please feel free to submit a pull request. I am always open to feedback and would love to hear your thoughts on how I can improve my understanding of algorithms and their analysis.
## Conclusion
Thank you for taking the time to visit my GitHub repository for the Algorithms Analysis course. I hope that you find my solutions to the course sheets and assignments helpful, and I look forward to any feedback or suggestions that you may have.
